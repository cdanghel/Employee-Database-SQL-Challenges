# Employee-Database-SQL-Challenges
We will utilize the Employees data set, leveraging its complexity to address two challenging tasks
exploring SQL more extensively.

## Challange 1
Analyze the annual distribution of male and female managers across various departments,
beginning in 1990, and compare the respective numbers.

## Challange 2
Analyze and contrast the mean salaries of female and male employees across the entire 
company up until the year 2002, while incorporating a filter that enables department-specific comparisons.
